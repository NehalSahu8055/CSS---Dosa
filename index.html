            A dosa is a thin, spicy, crispy crÃªpe-like food made from fermented rice, and it is very popular in restaurants in South India. It may be served plain with sambar and chutneys such as coconut chutney (as pictured), or other curry or gravy. When served with potato folded inside, it is known as masala dosa
